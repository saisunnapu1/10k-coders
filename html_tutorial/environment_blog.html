        <h1>ENVIRONMENT POLLUTION</h1>
        <P>Environmental Pollution is the effect caused by undesirable changes in our surroundings that have harmful impacts on plants, animals, and human beings.  A substance that causes Pollution is known as a Pollutant. Pollutants can be solid, liquid, or gaseous substances present in greater concentrations than in natural abundance and may produce due to human activities or natural happenings.</P>
        <P> For example, substances such as plastic materials, heavy metals, etc., once released into the atmosphere. By natural processes, it cannot be degraded and are harmful to living organisms. In environmental pollution, pollutants originate from a source and get transported by air or water and are dumped into the soil by human beings.</P>

            <p>For example, an average human being requires around 12−15 times more air than food. So, even a tiny amount of pollutants in the air become significant compared to similar levels present in the food. Pollutants can be degradable, like discarded vegetables which rapidly break down by the natural process. Slowly degradable pollutants remain in the environment unchanged for many decades.</p>
